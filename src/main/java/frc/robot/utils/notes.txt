Behavior of swerve wheels drive motors: 
    all wheels move correctly with phoenix tuner being used as an input
    checked behavior with constant speed of .2 and -.2 for each motor
    this should mean that it isn't a mechanical problem

    all wheels move correctly when inputing a constant percent output in a testing method
    checked behavior with constant speed of .2 and -.2 for each motor

    just front right is exibiting stopping and starting 
    checked behavior with human joystick inputs

    wheels not moving correctly with inputs based on buttons
    checked behavior by toggling between 5 different speeds, .2, .4, .6, .8, 0
    problems would occur when holding the buttons which would causing rapid switches between the target speed and 0
    this would jamming that appears to resemble the behavior of the robot when using joystick inputs

    wheels moving correctly with inputs based on pressing buttons
    checked behavior by toggling between 5 different speeds, .2, .4, .6, .8, 0
    no problems occur because there was no scenarios when rapid switches could occur

    wheels not moving correctly with inputs (.6 to .7) from controller
    wheels are switching between from target to 0 consistently 
    does not occur at any other values
    this error occured because the deadzone was to small to catch small values
    this error was fixed when the deadzone was created large enough to catch the small values

    wheels are moving correctly and not correctly with the previously described conditions
    the wheels work and not work at seemingly random occasions
    one the wheels start working or stop working they stay in the state of functionality for some time

Things to verify:

  angleMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition returns the correct value 
yes
   angleEnc.getAbsolutePosition returns the correct value 
yes
   syncing the angleEnc.getAbsolutePosition with the angleMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition results in the same values 
yes
   Confirming that the PID constants are being changed via the self-test snapshot
yes
   Confirm that error and pid targets are correct
The error seems to be incorrect
   Tune PID coefficients 

   Set angleOffsets at the start of matches so that the motors start facing forwards

Our current tick range is 0-2048. In the method `SetPIDTarget` in SwerveWheel.java, we tested values in the range of 0-2048
to see how the wheels would behave. The following are what we found out:

- The robot sometimes needs to be deployed code TWICE for the position to properly register - i.e. we tried to make the
wheel go to 1024, and it didn't work, and then I deployed the code again, and it worked. who knows why ;
- [10:49] The wheels work turning from 0 to 1024, each time only needing one deployment
- [10:51] Going from 0 to 512 worked with one deployment (but a ONE TIME OCCASION of 1024-0 flipped twice)
- [10:54] Continuing from 512 to 1024, 1024 to 1536, and 1536 to 2047 worked with one deployment
- [10:57] Going from 2048 to 1536, 1536 to 1024, 1024 to 512, and 512 to 0 worked with one deployment.
- [11:04] The robot makes unconsistent errors, such as moving twice per one enable
- [11:14] The wheel is very sensative to controller movement, has specific setpoints that it likes going to
            Will ocasionally rotate randomly P-value - .5
- [11:16] The wheel does a 359 when reaching the edge of movement range
- [11:18] Enabled optimize which resulted in oscillations around setpoint P-value: .015
- [11:21] Reducing the P-value(.005) resulted in no behavior after the wheel reaches 0. The behavior before it 
            reaches 0 is jittery. Automaticallys moves 0, and will not move away from 0. 
- [11:26] Not responding to control input properly. The PID error is not resulting in movement. 
- [11:27] Intense oscillations with a p-value of (.05).
- [11:31] Best behavior yet, moves to setpoints with slight oscillations that fade, only can move to specific setpoints

- P of .05, target of 0, error of 48 encoder ticks, target of 512 error of 40 encoder ticks,
- changing target value from 512 to 532 had no behavior, adding on the error by 
- adding in a I of .00005 reduced the error to 0,

- Offset of -260, absolute value was 200 
- Offset of -200, absolute value was close to 0, and orientation of actual wheel was 90 degrees Offset clockwise
- Offset of +200, absolute value was close to 200, and orientation was 90 degrees offset counter clickwise
- Offset of 0, absolute value was 333, and orientation was roughly 110 degrees Offset counter clockwise

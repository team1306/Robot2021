Things to verify:

  angleMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition returns the correct value 
yes
   angleEnc.getAbsolutePosition returns the correct value 
yes
   syncing the angleEnc.getAbsolutePosition with the angleMotor.getSelectedSensorPosition results in the same values 
yes
   Confirming that the PID constants are being changed via the self-test snapshot

   Confirm that error and pid targets are correct

   Tune PID coefficients 

   Set angleOffsets at the start of matches so that the motors start facing forwards

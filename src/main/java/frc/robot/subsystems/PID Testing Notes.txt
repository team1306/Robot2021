Speed Motors:
P: .01
To small for movement

P: .015
Works, what we are currently using

P: .02
Seemingly roughly correct
Slight oscillations at high speeds on the backRight motor 

P: .04, I: 0, D: 0
Heavy oscillations around target velocity

P: .05, I: 0, D: 0
Expected behavior 
Oscillations observed at edeges of the joystick, extreme values quickly changing
Removal of optimize resulted in expected behavior
Forwards and backwards are the same direction 
Large oscillations in all but back right motor

P: .065, I: 0, D: 0
Oscillations on back left and front right motors when accelerating and at high velocities
Expected behavior from back right and front left motors
Maximum speed is very low compared to potential

P: .1, I: 0, D: 0
Oscillations on all motors when accelerating

P: .15, I: 0, D: 0
Intense oscillations on all motors at most times

Angle Motors (does not appear to be an issue with the P value):

P: .1 
No behavior

P: .5
Nothing

P: 1
Nothing

P: 1.25
Jittery ( 1 wheel )
only that wheel moves

P: 1.5
Jittery ( 1 wheel )
only that wheel moves

p: 2
bouncy ( 1 wheel )
only that wheel moves

Speed Motors:
P: .05, I: 0, D: 0
No behavior observed

P: .065, I: 0, D: 0
Oscillations on back left and front right motors when accelerating and at high velocities
Expected behavior from back right and front left motors
Maximum speed is very low compared to potential

P: .1, I: 0, D: 0
Oscillations on all motors when accelerating

P: .15, I: 0, D: 0
Intense oscillations on all motors at most times
